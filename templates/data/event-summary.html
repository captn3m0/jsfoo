    , 'blurb' : '<p>JSFoo is India\'s premier JavaScript conference. Join us on September 17 - 20, 2014 at the <a href="/2014/venue">MLR Convention Centre, JP Nagar, Bangalore</a> for the sixth edition of JSFoo. Letâ€™s bring together the people creating the future of the web.</p><p>In 2011, Node.js put JavaScript firmly in the backend, making JavaScript developers productive at both ends of the stack, and making it possible for business logic to finally be moved into JavaScript. In 2012, AngularJS made us think about moving business logic completely into the client-side as an actually sensible idea. Meteor give that idea two thumbs up. In 2013, we went wild thinking of all the possibilities. JavaScript phones! Robots! In 2014, it\'s time for some sobering up. The backends we built over a decade in Ruby and Python aren\'t going away. New languages like Go and Hack are tantalising us with new possibilities. Our applications are increasingly distributed, often involving third party APIs. In such a scenario, where does your business logic reside? In 2014, JavaScript is no longer a toothless child or a rebellious teenager that wants to do everything itself. <span class="semibold">JSFoo 2014 is about working with JavaScript as the centerpiece of a complex web stack.</span></p>'
