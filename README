[Sorry for the mess]

- all the browser js is in client/. Read client/README.md for stack description. 

start up the server - 
node app

then go to localhost:3000/examples/grid to see some moving cubes. 


for developing 
--------------
cd client
grunt #once, for luck
grunt watch  #compiles jsfoo.js on file change
